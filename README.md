# shiny

Shiny is an experimental project I'm using to learn more about scrapy. I'm using the firefly wikia as my subject.

If I get enough tangible information out of it, this project will evolve into a publicly hosted API. Similar to pokeapi and swapi.

The eventual goal is to use what I learn here to scrape memory-alpha for a fully featured Star Trek API.
